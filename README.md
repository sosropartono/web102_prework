# WEB102 Prework - **Sea Monster Crowd Funding**

Submitted by: **William Sosropartono**

**Sea Monster Crowd Funding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

* With the use of a framework such as React, we can replace a lot of site with components, which allows the site to be reactive and have state, so we can implement some sort of live updates.
* We can maybe add more information when a certain game card is clicked on. 
* Have a visual component that shows the amount of money raised and the goal.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

-I have not worked with javascript in a while, so getting used to the syntax and relearning methods such as reduce, and filter was challenging.
-I also had a difficult time understanding the intricacies of destructuring, needed to look up how it worked on MDN documents. 
-In order to make the app look like the example I had to figure out which css elements to apply new rules to and learn some new css rules. 
-Overall a great and enriching experience.
